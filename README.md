# Planheat-Tool
The Planheat tool is the heart of the Planheat project (for more information on the project, have a look at our website http://planheat.eu/). Composed of several modules, it will help your city to simulate its way to decarbonising its heating and cooling system by showing you economically feasible scenarios.
