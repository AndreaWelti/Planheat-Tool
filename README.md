# Planheat-Tool
The Planheat tool is the heart of the Planheat project (for more information on the project, have a look at our website http://planheat.eu/). Composed of several modules, it will help your city to simulate its way to decarbonising its heating and cooling system by showing you economically feasible scenarios.

The tool is a platform that integrates three open source modules – the mapping module, the planning module, the simulation module – and a KPI panel. The platform allows the visualisation and mapping of results, the visualisation of the scenarios selected with the planning tool, and the visualisation of results coming from the numerical simulations.

The Planheat tool aims at supporting local authorities in:

    - Mapping – planning – simulating the local energy demand and supply
    - Showing possible future scenarios
    - Understanding and comparing these new scenarios
    - Identifying potentials for the existing network
    - Telling you the energetic, economic and environmental gains!
